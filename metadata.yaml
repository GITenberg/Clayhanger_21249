description: "The Clayhanger Family is a series of novels by Arnold Bennett, published\
  \ between 1910 and 1918. Though the series is commonly referred to as a \"trilogy\"\
  , and the first three novels were published in a single volume, as The Clayhanger\
  \ Family, in 1925, there are actually four books. All four are set in the \"Five\
  \ Towns\", Bennett's thinly disguised version of the six towns of the Potteries\
  \ district that merged into the borough (later city) of Stoke-on-Trent. Buildings\
  \ described in the novels are still identifiable in Burslem, the basis for the fictional\
  \ town of \"Bursley\".\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
